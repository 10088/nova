    Fix bug 1693168. v2.1 API which does not return the ``server_groups`` and
    ``server_group_members`` quotas in GET and PUT ``os-quota-class-sets`` API
    response. v2 API used to return those keys in the API response.
    Microversion 2.50 restored that behavior. In microversion 2.50, the
    ``server_groups`` and ``server_group_members`` keys are exposed in
    GET and PUT ``os-quota-class-sets`` APIs Response body.
    Fix bug 1701211. Network related quotas are filtered out of
    ``os-quota-class-sets`` APIs and not available from microversion
    2.50 onwards.
    Filtered quotas are:

    - 'fixed_ips'
    - 'floating ips'
    - 'security_groups'
    - 'security_group_rules'
    - 'networks'
