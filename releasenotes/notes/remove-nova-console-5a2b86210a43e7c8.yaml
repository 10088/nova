    The following APIs have been removed. Calling these APIs will
    now result in a ``410 HTTPGone`` error response:

    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/consoles``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/consoles``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/consoles/{console_id}``
    * ``DELETE /servers/{server_id}/consoles/{console_id}``

    In addition, the following policies are removed. These were related to the
    removed APIs listed above and no longer had any effect:

    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:index``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:create``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:delete``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:show``
