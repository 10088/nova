    The *nova-network* feature has been deprecated since the 14.0.0 (Newton)
    release and has now been removed. The remaining *nova-network* specific
    REST APIs have been removed along with their related policy rules. Calling
    these APIs will now result in a ``410 (Gone)`` error response.

    * ``GET /os-security-group-default-rules``
    * ``POST /os-security-group-default-rules``
    * ``GET /os-security-group-default-rules/{id}``
    * ``DELETE /os-security-group-default-rules/{id}``

    The following policies have also been removed.

    * ``os_compute_api:os-security-group-default-rules``
