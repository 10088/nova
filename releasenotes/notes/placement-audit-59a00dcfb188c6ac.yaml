    A new ``nova-manage placement audit`` CLI has been added to help identify
    orphaned compute allocations in the Placement API that are no longer
    related to either instances or migrations.
    Some race conditions in Nova could not remove allocations for some
    instances or migrations when they're done and then it would create some
    capacity issues. Thanks to the command, you could know the orphaned
    allocations and ask to remove them.
    For more details on CLI usage, see the man page entry:
