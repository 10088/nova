    Nova leaks resource allocations in placement during
    ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (revertResize Action)`` if the
    allocation held by the migration_uuid is modified in parallel with the
    revert operation. Nova will log an ERROR and will put the server into ERROR
    state but will not delete the migration allocation. We assume that this can
    only happen if somebody outside of nova is actively changing the migration
    allocation in placement. Therefore it is not considered as a bug.
