    A new configuration option ``[libvirt]/live_migration_timeout_action``
    is added. This new option will have choices ``abort`` (default)
    or ``force_complete``. This option will determine what actions will be
    taken against a VM after ``live_migration_completion_timeout`` expires.
    Currently nova just aborts the live migrate operation after completion
    timeout expires. By default, we keep the same behavior of aborting after
    completion timeout. ``force_complete`` will either pause the VM or trigger
    post-copy depending on if post copy is enabled and available.

    The ``[libvirt]/live_migration_completion_timeout`` is restricted by
    minimum 0 and will now raise a ValueError if the configuration option
    value is less than minimum value.
