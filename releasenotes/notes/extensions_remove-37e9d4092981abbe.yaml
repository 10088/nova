    The following policy enforcement points have been removed as part
    of the restructuring of the Nova API code. The attributes that
    could have been hidden with these policy points will now always be
    shown / accepted.

     * os_compute_api:os-disk-config - show / accept
       ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` parameter

    The following entry points have been removed

     * nova.api.v21.extensions.server.resize - allowed accepting
       additional parameters on resize requests.
