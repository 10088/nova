upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova-consoleauth`` service has been deprecated and new consoles will
    have their token authorizations stored in cell databases instead of in the
    ``nova-consoleauth`` service backend. With this, console proxies are
    required to be deployed per cell. All existing consoles will be reset. For
    most operators, this should be a minimal disruption as the default TTL of a
    console token is 10 minutes.

    Operators that have configured a much longer token TTL or otherwise wish to
    avoid immediately resetting all existing consoles can use the new
    configuration option ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth`` to fall back on
    the ``nova-consoleauth`` service for locating existing console
    authorizations. The option defaults to False. Once all of the existing
    consoles have naturally expired, operators may unset the configuration
    option and discontinue running the consoleauth service. For example, if
    a deployment has configured a token TTL of one hour, the operator may
    disable the ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth`` option and stop running
    the ``nova-consoleauth`` service one hour after deploying the new code.

    Operators who do not need to use the ``[workarounds]/enable_consoleauth``
    configuration option may discontinue running the consoleauth service
    immediately.
