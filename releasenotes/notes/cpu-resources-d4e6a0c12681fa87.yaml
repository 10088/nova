    Compute nodes using the libvirt driver can now report ``PCPU`` inventory.
    This is consumed by instances with dedicated (pinned) CPUs. This can be
    configured using the ``[compute] cpu_dedicated_set`` config option. A
    legacy path using the now deprecated ``vcpu_pin_set`` config option is
    provided to assist with upgrades. Refer to the help text of the ``[compute]
    cpu_dedicated_set``, ``[compute] cpu_shared_set`` and ``vcpu_pin_set``
    config options for more information.
  - |
    A new configuration option, ``[compute] cpu_dedicated_set``, has been
    added. This can be used to configure the host CPUs that should be used for
    ``PCPU`` inventory.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``vcpu_pin_set`` configuration option has been deprecated. You should
    migrate host CPU configuration to the ``[compute] cpu_dedicated_set`` or
    ``[compute] cpu_shared_set`` config options, or both. Refer to the help
    text of these config options for more information.
upgrade:
  - |
    Previously, if ``vcpu_pin_set`` was not defined, the libvirt driver would
    count all available host CPUs when calculating ``VCPU`` inventory,
    regardless of whether those CPUs were online or not. The driver will now
    only report the total number of online CPUs. This should result in fewer
    build failures on hosts with offlined CPUs.
