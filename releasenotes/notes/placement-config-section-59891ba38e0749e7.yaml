features:
  - The nova-compute worker now communicates with the new placement API
    service. Nova determines the placement API service by querying the
    OpenStack service catalog for the service with a service type of
    'placement'.
  - A new [placement] section is added to the nova.conf configuration file for
    configuration options affecting how Nova interacts with the new placement
    API service. The only configuration option currently available is
    `os_region_name` which provides support for Nova to query the appropriate
    OpenStack region's service catalog for the placement service.
