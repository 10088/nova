upgrade:
  - |
    A sys-admin privsep daemon has been added and needs to be included in your
    rootwrap configuration.
  - |
    Calls to mount in the virt disk api no longer ignore the value of stderr.
  - |
    The nova-idmapshift binary has been removed. This has been replaced by
    internal functionality using privsep.
  - |
    The following commands are no longer required to be listed in your rootwrap
    configuration: cat; chown; cryptsetup; dd; losetup; lvcreate; lvremove;
    lvs; mkdir; mount; nova-idmapshift; ploop; prl_disk_tool; readlink; shred;
    tee; touch; umount; vgs; and xend.
