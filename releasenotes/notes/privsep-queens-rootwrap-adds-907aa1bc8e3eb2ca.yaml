upgrade:
  - |
    A sys-admin privsep daemon has been added and needs to be included in your
    rootwrap configuration.
  - |
    Calls to mount in the virt disk api no longer ignore the value of stderr.
  - |
    The following commands are no longer required to be listed in your rootwrap
    configuration: cat; chown; cryptsetup; dd; mkdir; mount; ploop;
    prl_disk_tool; readlink; tee; touch; and umount.
