    Live migrations are now initially slowed to ensure Neutron is given
    adequate time to wire up the VIFs on the destination. Once complete Neutron
    will send an event to Nova returning the migration to full speed. This
    requires Neutron >=11.0.4 on Pike when used with LinuxBridge VIFs in order
    to pick up the Icb039ae2d465e3822ab07ae4f9bc405c1362afba bugfix.
