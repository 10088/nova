    The 2.63 compute REST API microversion adds support for the
    ``trusted_image_certificates`` parameter, which is used to define a
    list of trusted certificate IDs that can be used during image
    signature verification and certificate validation. The list is
    restricted to a maximum of 50 IDs. Note that there is not support
    with volume-backed servers.

    The ``trusted_image_certificates`` request parameter can be passed to
    the server create and rebuild APIs (if allowed by policy):

    * ``POST /servers``
    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (rebuild)``

    The following policy rules were added to restrict the usage of the
    ``trusted_image_certificates`` request parameter in the server create and
    rebuild APIs:

    * ``os_compute_api:servers:create:trusted_certs``
    * ``os_compute_api:servers:rebuild:trusted_certs``

    The ``trusted_image_certificates`` parameter will be in the response
    body of the following APIs (not restricted by policy):

    * ``GET /servers/detail``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}``
    * ``PUT /servers/{server_id}``
    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/action (rebuild)``
