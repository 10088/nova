    An optional configuration group placement_database can be used in
    nova.conf to configure a separate database for use with the placement
    API.

    We recommend setting the placement_database.connection setting to
    a non-None value in order to ease upgrade and migration of Nova in
    Ocata. Although we leave the default value of this setting to None
    -- in order to not break any deployments that use continuous delivery
    models -- setting this to a non-None value now will avoid a potentially
    lengthy data migration in the future.

    If placement_database.connection has a value this will be used as the
    connection URL for the placement database. Before launching the
    placement API service, the 'nova-manage placement sync' command
    must be run to create the necessary tables.

    When the setting is None the existing settings for the api_database
    will be used for hosting placement API data.
