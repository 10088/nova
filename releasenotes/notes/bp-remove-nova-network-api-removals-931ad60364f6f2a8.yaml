    The *nova-network* service has been deprecated since the 14.0.0 Newton
    release and now the following *nova-network* specific REST APIs have been
    removed along with their related policy rules. Calling these APIs will now
    result in a ``410 HTTPGone`` error response.

    * ``GET /os-fping``
    * ``GET /os-fping/{server_id}``

    In addition, the following configuration options have been removed.

    * ``[api]/fping_path``
