deprecations:

  - The ``/os-certificates`` API is deprecated, as well as the
    ``nova-cert`` service which powers it. This is a vestigial part of
    the Nova API that existed only for EC2 support, which is now
    maintained out of tree. It does not interact with any of the rest
    of nova, and should not just be used as a certificates as a
    service, which is all it is currently good for.
