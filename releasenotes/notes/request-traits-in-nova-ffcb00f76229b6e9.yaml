    Add traits support to the Nova. The new flavor extra spec is added to
    support specifying the required traits. The syntax of extra spec is
    as below:

    - trait:HW_CPU_X86_AVX2=required
    - trait:STORAGE_DISK_SSD=required

    The scheduler will pass traits to the GET /allocation_candidates endpoint
    in the Placement API to filter out resource providers with each of the
    required traits. Currently the only valid value is required. For any other
    value will be considered as invalid.
