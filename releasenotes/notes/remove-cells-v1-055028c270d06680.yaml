upgrade:
  - |
    The *cells v1* feature has been deprecated since the 16.0.0 Pike release
    and has now been removed. The ``nova-cells`` service and ``nova-manage
    cells`` commands have been removed, while the ``nova-manage cell_v2
    simple_cell_setup`` command will no longer check if cells v1 is enabled and
    therefore can no longer exit with ``2``.

    The *cells v1* specific REST APIs have
    been removed along with their related policy rules. Calling these APIs will
    now result in a ``410 (Gone)`` error response.

    * ``GET /os-cells``
    * ``POST /os-cells``
    * ``GET /os-cells/capacities``
    * ``GET /os-cells/detail``
    * ``GET /os-cells/info``
    * ``POST /os-cells/sync_instances``
    * ``GET /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``PUT /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``DELETE /os-cells/{cell_id}``
    * ``GET /os-cells/{cell_id}/capacities``
