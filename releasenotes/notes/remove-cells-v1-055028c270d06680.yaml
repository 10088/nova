    The *cells v1* feature has been deprecated since the 16.0.0 Pike release
    and has now been removed. The ``nova-cells`` service has been removed. The
    *cells v1* specific REST APIs have been removed along with their related
    policy rules. Calling these APIs will now result in a ``410 (Gone)`` error
    response.
