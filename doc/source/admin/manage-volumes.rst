Manage volumes
==============

Depending on the setup of your cloud provider, they may give you an endpoint to
use to manage volumes. You can use the ``openstack`` CLI to manage volumes.

For the purposes of the compute service, attaching, detaching and
:doc:`creating a server from a volume <../user/launch-instance-from-volume>`
are of primary interest.

Refer to the `block storage service CLI guide on managing volumes
<https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/cli/cli-manage-volumes.html>`_.
